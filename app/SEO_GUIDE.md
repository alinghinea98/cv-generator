# SEO Guide for makemecv.org

## What is SEO?

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of improving your website's visibility in search engine results (Google, Bing, etc.). When someone searches for "CV builder" or "resume generator", you want your site to appear at the top.

## How SEO Works

1. **Crawling**: Search engines (like Google) send bots to visit your website
2. **Indexing**: They analyze your content and store it in their database
3. **Ranking**: When someone searches, Google shows the most relevant results first
4. **Factors**: Many factors affect ranking (content quality, speed, mobile-friendliness, backlinks, etc.)

## What We've Implemented

### ✅ 1. Meta Tags (index.html)
- **Title Tag**: Appears in search results and browser tabs
- **Description**: Shows under your title in search results
- **Keywords**: Helps search engines understand your content
- **Open Graph**: Makes your site look good when shared on Facebook/LinkedIn
- **Twitter Cards**: Makes your site look good when shared on Twitter

### ✅ 2. Structured Data (JSON-LD)
- Tells search engines exactly what your site is
- Can show rich snippets (ratings, features, etc.) in search results
- Helps Google understand you're a CV builder application

### ✅ 3. Sitemap (sitemap.xml)
- Lists all your important pages
- Helps search engines discover and index your content
- Should be submitted to Google Search Console

### ✅ 4. Robots.txt
- Tells search engines which pages to crawl
- Points to your sitemap
- Prevents indexing of private pages (login, wizard)

### ✅ 5. Dynamic SEO Component
- Allows different meta tags for each page
- Better than static tags for React apps
